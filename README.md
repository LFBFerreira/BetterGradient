# BetterGradients

BetterGradients is a Processing library based on Jeremy Behreandt's tutorial: [Color Gradients in Processing](https://medium.com/@behreajj/color-gradients-in-processing-v-2-0-e5c0b87cdfd2)

The aim of the library is to wrap the code that Jeremy used in his tutorial in easy-to-use classes and methods. And with it you get:
- livelier and more colorfull gradients, using Ken Perlinâ€™s ["smoother step"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep) approach
- gradients class with adjustable colorstops for uneven gradients
- color composition and decomposition using bitwise operation
- lots of examples of gradient techniques 

Tested with Processing 3.5.4.
